        <h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
        <p>
          Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called
          "stone", or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game, usually played between two people, in
          which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are
          "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle
          finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory"
          or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides
          to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors"
          or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of
          paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the
          game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The type of game originated in China and
          spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time.
